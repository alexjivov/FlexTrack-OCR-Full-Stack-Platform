# Monthly Finance OCR App

## Problem to Solve

* Organizing your monthly expenses and tracking your expenses online.  This is a paperless version of tracking expenses. 

## Solution

* Users must create an account and log in.  The user would upload a picture of a receipt that will then go through an OCR that will transcribe the image into text.  The user will then copy and paste the lines of expenses that have rendered on their screen, type in the store name, type in the address, and insert the date.  They will submit the data and upon doing so, the data will be saved to MongoDB.  The user can then browse each month’s expenses, rendering each month’s expenses and populating charts.  

## Why it’s important
* Paperless way of organizing expenses
* Tracking monthly expense trends
